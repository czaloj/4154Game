It was later adjusted for use in INFO3152's Design Lab 2.

Instructions:
1. Open TileViewer.swf with any Flash-enabled browser

   Tiles.png into the same directory folder as TileViewe.swf
4. Refresh your browser, or open TileViewer.swf in another browser tab
5. Observe that the platforms now use your custom tile set. Take note of
   any places that don't look very good and adjust these in your psd file.
